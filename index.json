It is to be used with a stimulus isolation adaptor from BIOPAC, more specifically one of the models that provide isolated voltage: https://www.biopac.com/product/stimulus-isolation-adapters/.\nThe idea is simple, we use the true analog output ports from the Arduino DUE as an independent channel and amplify their signals using Operational amplifiers. In this case two LM741 from Texas instruments. Using serial communication the system can be controlled in various ways, from the Arduino IDE to whatever programming languages (Python, Matlab, etc).\n Project repository Author: Andre M Chagas ","date":1580795054,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580795054,"objectID":"c53189d1b16df8f25aa1798af0d80245","permalink":"/project/voltageamp/","publishdate":"2020-02-04T05:44:14Z","relpermalink":"/project/voltageamp/","section":"project","summary":"A voltage amplifier compatible with Arduino Due","tags":["fMRI","Psychology","arduino"],"title":"Voltage amplifier","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andre Maia Chagas"],"categories":[],"content":"A project developed for the Singer Lab , based on Sinkala et al 2012 we developed a 3D printable microfluidic chamber for electrode calibration.
